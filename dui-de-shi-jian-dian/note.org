I start to document the notes of the song, but I know nothing about
the music theory.

First, I find something like this on the Internet:

#+begin_src lilypond :file dui-de-shi-jian-dian.png

\layout { \omit Voice.StringNumber }
\new StaffGroup <<
   \new Staff \relative {
     \clef "treble_8"
     c16 d e f g4
     c,16\5 d\5 e\4 f\4 g4\4
     c,16 d e f g4
   }
   \new TabStaff \relative {
     c16 d e f g4
     c,16\5 d\5 e\4 f\4 g4\4
     \set TabStaff.minimumFret = #5
     \set TabStaff.restrainOpenStrings = ##t
     c,16 d e f g4
   }
>>
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:dui-de-shi-jian-dian/dui-de-shi-jian-dian.png]]

How to change the pitch? For example, I used the clip on the fourth
fret, what does it mean? It seems that I miss a lot of info. It's time
to put the guitar off and learn some ABCs.
